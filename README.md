# Sol

**Single Observability Layer** — a high-performance, end-to-end observability data pipeline built in Rust.

Sol collects, transforms, and routes logs, metrics, and traces to any destination.
Deploy as an agent, aggregator, or both.

## Features

- **High performance** — written in Rust, memory-safe and multi-threaded
- **Unified** — logs, metrics, and traces in one tool
- **Vendor-neutral** — route data to any backend, switch vendors without disruption
- **Reliable** — built-in delivery guarantees, disk-backed buffering
- **Extensible** — 100+ sources, transforms, and sinks

## Sol vs Vector

Sol is a fork of [Datadog Vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector). The table below summarizes what changed.

| | **Vector** | **Sol** |
|---|---|---|
| **Maintainer** | Datadog | Independent (Clément Boudereau) |
| **License** | MPL-2.0 | MPL-2.0 (unchanged) |
| **Binary name** | `vector` | `sol` |
| **Config path** | `/etc/vector/vector.yaml` | `/etc/sol/sol.yaml` |
| **Data directory** | `/var/lib/vector/` | `/var/lib/sol/` |
| **Env var prefix** | `VECTOR_*` | `SOL_*` |
| **Metrics namespace** | `vector_*` | `sol_*` |
| **Systemd unit** | `vector.service` | `sol.service` |
| **Crate names** | `vector-core`, `vector-lib`, … | `sol-core`, `sol-lib`, … |
| **Core protocol** | Vendor-neutral | OTLP-first (OpenTelemetry) |
| **Self-monitoring** | Internal metrics | OTLP pipeline → Parquet → SQL |
| **Goal** | General-purpose pipeline | Single Observability Layer for self-hosted SaaS |

All Vector sources, transforms, and sinks remain fully compatible.

### Why Sol over Vector?

Sol diverges from Vector on protocol and architecture choices. The table below summarizes the key differences.

| Area | **Vector** | **Sol** | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core protocol** | Proprietary `LogEvent` / `Metric` / `TraceEvent` types | OTLP-native (`OtelLog`, `OtelMetric`, `OtelSpan`) | No lossy conversion — data enters and exits as standard OpenTelemetry. Removes ~14K lines of vendor-specific code. |
| **Histogram format** | HDR Histogram / sketches (unbounded memory) | ExponentialHistogram (base-2 exponential buckets) | Bounded memory, lossless merge across agents, native OTLP encoding. |
| **OTLP output purity** | Injects `vector.*` attributes into telemetry | Zero custom attributes — pipeline state stays in struct fields | Clean, spec-compliant OTLP output. No downstream filtering needed. |
| **StatsD handling** | Emits one metric per UDP packet | Flush-interval aggregation with delta temporality | Bounded output cardinality, OTLP-compliant timestamps and temporality. |
| **Resource / Scope** | Not populated on most sources | Sensible defaults on every metric source | Correct OTLP semantics out of the box — no manual enrichment transforms. |
| **Sink normalization** | Global temporality setting | Per-sink temporality and ExponentialHistogram conversion | Each destination gets exactly the format it expects; no global compromise. |
| **Encoding** | `Value` intermediary → proto conversion | Direct proto field encoding | Fewer allocations, lower latency on the serialization path. |
| **Self-monitoring** | Internal metrics API | OTLP pipeline → Parquet → SQL with Grafana dashboards | Query pipeline health with SQL; ship with ready-made dashboards. |
| **Tail sampling** | `sample` transform (head-based / probabilistic only) | `tail_sampling` transform: assembles full traces, VRL policies, AND/OR composition, regex matching | Decide per-trace after all spans arrive — keep errors, slow requests, drop noise. Reduces storage costs without losing important traces. |
| **Trace-aware load balancing** | No built-in trace routing | OTLP gRPC sink with consistent-hash routing on `trace_id` or `service.name` (static, DNS, K8s resolvers) | All spans for a trace land on the same collector — required for correct tail sampling in multi-instance deployments. |
| **Migration** | — | Vector source for zero-downtime fleet migration | Drop-in replacement: existing Vector agents forward to Sol with no config change. |
